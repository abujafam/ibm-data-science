## Exercise 1: Using Joins

### Question 1
Write and execute a SQL query to list the school names, community names and average attendance for communities with a hardship index of 98





```sql
%%sql
select S.NAME_OF_SCHOOl, S.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, S.AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, CS.HARDSHIP_INDEX
FROM CHICAGOSCHOOLS S LEFT JOIN  CHICAGOCENSUS CS ON  S.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER =CS.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER

## Exercise 2: Creating a View
For privacy reasons, you have been asked to create a view that enables users to select just the school name and the icon fields from the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table. By providing a view, you can ensure that users cannot see the actual scores given to a school, just the icon associated with their score. You should define new names for the view columns to obscure the use of scores and icons in the original table.

### Question 1
Write and execute a SQL statement to create a view showing the columns listed in the following table, with new column names as shown in the second column.
 Column name in CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS	Column name in view



```sql
%%sql 
DROP VIEW SCHOOL_VIEW
```

## Exercise 3: Creating a Stored Procedure
### Question 1
Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer. Donâ€™t forget to use the #SET TERMINATOR statement to use the @ for the CREATE statement terminator.

### Question 2
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the in_Leader_Score parameter.
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

### Question 3
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information.





```sql
%%sql
--#SET TERMINATOR @
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE (
    IN in_School_ID  INTEGER, IN in_Leader_Score INTEGER) 
LANGUAGE SQL 
MODIFIES SQL DATA
  BEGIN
    UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
    SET Leaders_Score = in_Leader_Score
    WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    IF in_Leader_Score >=  80 THEN 
        UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
        SET Leaders_Icon = 'Very_Strong'
        WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    ELSEIF in_Leader_Score>= 60 and in_Leader_Score <= 79  THEN
        UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
        SET Leaders_Icon = 'Strong'
        WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    ELSEIF in_Leader_Score >=  40 and in_Leader_Score <= 59  THEN
        UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
        SET Leaders_Icon = 'Average'
        WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    ELSEIF in_Leader_Score >=  20 and in_Leader_Score <= 39  THEN
        UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
        SET Leaders_Icon = 'Weak'
        WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    ELSE
        UPDATE "CHICAGOSCHOOLS"
        SET Leaders_Icon = 'Very Weak'
        WHERE School_ID = in_School_ID;
    END IF;
 
        IF retcode < 0 THEN                                  --  SQLCODE returns negative value for error, zero for success, positive value for warning
      ROLLBACK WORK;
